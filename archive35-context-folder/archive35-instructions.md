# Archive 35 — Cowork Setup Instructions

## Folder Structure

Place these files in a folder called `Archive35` (or whatever you prefer):

```
Archive35/
├── CONTEXT.md          ← Main profile & preferences
├── career-narrative.md ← Interview prep & stories
├── lighthaus-project.md ← AI assistant project notes
└── linkedin-outreach.md ← Templates & scripts
```

## The Prompt to Use

**Copy this prompt and use it at the start of every Cowork session:**

---

```
You are working with Wolf. Before doing anything, read all files in this folder to understand who I am and how I communicate.

Key things to internalize:
- I have ADHD/dyslexia — use bullets, bold key terms, short sentences, scannable output
- Auto-correct my voice-to-text errors (German accent) without mentioning them
- My job search "product" is: leadership for leaders, empowerment, people development
- If I drift into technical achievements, redirect me to people development
- Be direct and warm — peer-to-peer tone, not assistant-to-boss
- Default to SHORT responses unless complexity requires more

Reference files as needed:
- career-narrative.md → for interview prep, positioning, stories
- linkedin-outreach.md → for content, recruiter messages, networking
- lighthaus-project.md → for my AI assistant project work

Now, [YOUR ACTUAL TASK HERE]
```

## Quick-Start Prompts by Task Type

### Job Search Tasks
```
Read the context files. Help me [prepare for an interview at X / draft a LinkedIn post about Y / write a recruiter response].

Remember: my product is "leadership for leaders" — keep that central.
```

### Interview Prep
```
Read CONTEXT.md and career-narrative.md. I have an interview for [role] at [company].

Help me prepare answers that demonstrate my leadership approach, using Problem→Product→Result format.
```

### LinkedIn Content
```
Read CONTEXT.md and linkedin-outreach.md. I want to write a post about [topic].

Keep it scannable, authentic, and anchored to servant leadership.
```

### Lighthaus Project
```
Read CONTEXT.md and lighthaus-project.md. I'm working on [specific aspect].

Help me think through [architecture / MVP scope / positioning].
```

### General Tasks
```
Read CONTEXT.md first. Then help me [task].

Format for ADHD: bullets, bold terms, short sentences.
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Always start with "Read the context files"** — Cowork doesn't remember between sessions

2. **Be specific about which reference file matters** — saves tokens and focuses the response

3. **Remind about formatting if output gets dense** — say "make it scannable"

4. **Use "real talk" when you want direct feedback** — signals permission to be blunt

5. **If it drifts, say "what's my product?"** — triggers the redirect to leadership focus

## Updating the Context

When things change (new job target, updated narrative, etc.):
- Edit the relevant .md file directly
- Or ask me in chat to generate updated versions

The context folder is your "persistent memory" for Cowork — keep it current.
