### room-17-dining — Fine Dining Restaurant (Square)

**Target aspect ratio:** 1:1 (square (AR 1.00))
**Room type:** restaurant

```
Create a photorealistic interior photograph of a fine dining restaurant.

ROOM DESCRIPTION:
Upscale restaurant with warm, intimate atmosphere. Shot with a Canon EOS R5, 24mm lens, f/8, from eye level. The room should look lived-in but styled, as if from an Architectural Digest photoshoot.

LIGHTING:
pendant copper lights, warm indirect lighting, candles. No harsh shadows on the main wall.

FURNITURE & DETAILS:
round table with white linens, banquette seating. All elements should feel natural and high-end.

WALL TREATMENT:
exposed brick or warm wood paneling. The wall must have a prominent blank area for artwork placement.

CRITICAL — GREEN PLACEMENT ZONE:
On the main wall, place a single solid rectangle filled with EXACTLY this color: #00FF00 (pure bright green, RGB 0/255/0).

Green rectangle specifications:
- Width: approximately 717 pixels
- Height: approximately 717 pixels
- Aspect ratio: 1.00:1 (square format)
- The rectangle must be PERFECTLY rectangular with sharp, crisp edges
- NO rounded corners
- The green rectangle should look like a flat matte panel mounted on the wall
- It should be centered on the main wall, positioned at eye level

ANTI-REFLECTION RULES (MANDATORY — follow ALL of these):
- The green rectangle must NOT cast any color onto surrounding surfaces
- NO green glow, tint, reflection, or ambient light spill on ANY surface
- NO green reflected on the floor (hardwood, marble, concrete, or any material)
- NO green reflected on the ceiling
- NO green tint on nearby furniture, pillows, vases, lamps, or decorations
- NO green light scatter on metallic or glossy surfaces
- NO green color bleeding at the edges where the rectangle meets the wall
- Treat the green zone as a MATTE, NON-REFLECTIVE, NON-EMISSIVE flat panel
- The green panel does NOT emit light — it is opaque and matte, like a piece of painted cardboard mounted on the wall. It absorbs light, it does not reflect or emit it.
- If there are any reflective surfaces in the room (mirrors, glass tables, polished floors), they must NOT show any green whatsoever
- Check EVERY surface in the scene for green contamination before finalizing
- The ONLY green in the entire image must be the rectangle itself — nowhere else

SAFE ZONE REQUIREMENT:
The wall area AROUND the green rectangle must be CLEAR of obstructions:
- At least 15% extra wall space on each side (left, right, top, bottom) beyond the green rectangle must be clean, uninterrupted wall surface
- No furniture, frames, shelves, light fixtures, switches, vents, or decorative elements within this buffer zone
- The buffer zone should match the wall texture/color seamlessly — it is simply more wall
- Target safe zone: approximately 932x932 pixels centered around the green rectangle
- In your text response, please state: "Safe zone: [W]x[H] pixels, starting at position ([X], [Y])"

The green zone represents where fine art photography will be composited in post-production. It MUST be a clean, uniform #00FF00 with zero color bleeding.

IMAGE QUALITY:
- Photorealistic, 8K quality
- Professional interior architecture photography style
- Rich detail in textures (fabric, wood, stone, metal)
- Natural color grading (not oversaturated)
- No text, watermarks, logos, or human faces

Mediterranean-style outdoor seating with ocean view. Shot with a Canon EOS R5, 24mm lens, f/8, from eye level. The room should look lived-in but styled, as if from an Architectural Digest photoshoot.

LIGHTING:
natural sunlight, golden hour glow. No harsh shadows on the main wall.

FURNITURE & DETAILS:
wicker seating with cushions, low table, bougainvillea. All elements should feel natural and high-end.

WALL TREATMENT:
stucco or plastered wall beneath a wooden pergola. The wall must have a prominent blank area for artwork placement.
