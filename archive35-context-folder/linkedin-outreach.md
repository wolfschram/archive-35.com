## Recruiter Response Templates

### When Recruiter Reaches Out

**Initial Response:**
```
Thanks for reaching out. I'm actively exploring VP Engineering and senior leadership opportunities.

A few things that matter to me:
- Culture that values people development over pure execution
- Opportunity to build and transform, not just maintain
- Leadership team that sees engineering as strategic, not just delivery

Would love to learn more about [company] and this role. Open to a quick call this week?
```

### When Role Doesn't Fit

```
Appreciate you thinking of me. This particular role isn't quite the right fit — I'm focused on VP-level positions where I can drive transformation and develop engineering leaders.

If something at that level comes across your desk, I'd be glad to chat. Happy to stay connected.

## What NOT to Do in Outreach

❌ Long paragraphs
❌ Generic messages that could go to anyone
❌ Focusing on what Wolf needs vs. what he offers
❌ Over-explaining the layoff
❌ Being too humble (downplaying experience)
❌ Being too aggressive (demanding responses)
