## 🔴 SITE IS LIVE — PRODUCTION RULES

**Archive-35.com is LIVE. Real customers are browsing, signing up, and purchasing.**

Every change must be treated as a production deployment:

- **Test before pushing.** Health-check all critical pages after deploy (home, gallery, login, account, checkout flow)
- **Never break checkout.** Stripe integration, cart, and payment flow are revenue-critical
- **Never break auth.** Magic link login, sessions, and account pages must stay functional
- **Never break email.** Welcome emails, order confirmations, and Wolf notifications must keep flowing
- **Never break the Google Sheet webhook.** Order and signup logging is how Wolf tracks the business
- **Back up before major refactors.** If touching gallery.html, stripe-webhook.js, or send-magic-link.js — read the full file first
- **No experiments on main.** If something is risky, discuss with Wolf before pushing
- **Mobile matters.** Many visitors come from iPhone/Instagram links. Test mobile viewport behavior
- **Performance matters.** Gallery has CoverFlow animations — don't regress the idle-throttling or event listener cleanup
- **Self-test EVERY change.** After every commit+push, wait for Cloudflare deploy (~15-30s), then hard-refresh the live site in the browser and: (1) take a screenshot to visually verify, (2) check the browser console for JS errors, (3) test basic interactions (click, scroll, navigate). Never tell Wolf "it's deployed" without actually verifying it works. You have Chrome browser access — use it.

## AI Agent System (Phase 2)

The Archive-35 Agent is an AI-powered automation system integrated into the Studio Electron app. It handles photo analysis, content generation, and social posting.

### MANDATORY: Read Before Modifying Agent or Shared Files

1. **Read this CLAUDE.md** (you're reading it now)
2. **Read 08_Docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md** — especially Lessons 008, 022, 023, 027
3. **Read 08_Docs/Archive-35_Architecture_Integration_Blueprint.docx** — the boundary map

### File Zones (from Architecture Blueprint)

| Zone | Rule |
|------|------|
| **STUDIO** (existing pages) | Agent development must NEVER modify these files |
| **AGENT** (Agent pages + Python backend) | New files only. Safe to create and modify |
| **SHARED** (main.js, preload.js, Sidebar.js, App.js) | Changes require testing BOTH systems |

### Shared Zone Modification Rules

Before modifying any SHARED file:
- Read the ENTIRE file first
- Read LESSONS_LEARNED.md for relevant lessons
- Make the change (additive only when possible)
- Test Studio: verify all 12 Studio tabs work + deploy pipeline runs
- Test Agent: verify all 7 Agent tabs work + Dashboard shows ONLINE
- If ANYTHING breaks: revert immediately

### Agent Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Location |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Frontend | React (in Electron Studio) | 05_Studio/app/src/pages/Agent*.js |
| Backend | Python FastAPI (port 8035) | Archive 35 Agent/src/ |
| Database | SQLite + WAL mode | Archive 35 Agent/data/archive35.db |
| IPC Bridge | Electron IPC → HTTP proxy | preload.js → main.js → localhost:8035 |

### Agent Pages in Studio

| Tab | Component | Purpose |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Dashboard | AgentDashboard.js | Overview, stats, kill switches |
| Photos | AgentPhotoImport.js | Photo grid + vision analysis |
| Queue | AgentContentQueue.js | Content approval with visual previews |
| Pipeline | AgentPipelineMonitor.js | Audit logs + manual triggers |
| Etsy | AgentEtsyListings.js | Etsy listing preview + SKU pricing |
| Health | AgentHealthPanel.js | Service testing + pipeline visualization |
| Settings | AgentSettings.js | Agent-specific API keys + config |

### CRITICAL: Studio Already Generates AI Metadata

**Before touching Agent vision/content code, understand this:** Studio's photo ingest pipeline ALREADY calls Claude Haiku 4.5 to generate AI metadata for every photo. The Agent's analysis is COMPLEMENTARY, not a replacement.

#### Studio Ingest Pipeline (ContentIngest.js → main.js IPC)

The full photo lifecycle starts in Studio, NOT the Agent:

```
Camera → Lightroom export → Studio ContentIngest.js → 01_Portfolio/ → Deploy → Live site
```

**Phase 1 — Scan + AI Analysis** (`analyze-photos` IPC in main.js):
- Reads EXIF data (camera, lens, GPS, date, exposure)
- Resizes to 800×800px for API call
- Calls Claude Haiku 4.5 to generate: **title, description, location, tags**
- User reviews and edits AI output before finalizing (AI gets sunrise/sunset wrong!)

**Phase 2 — User Review**:
- Wolf reviews every AI-generated title, description, location, and tag set
- Manual corrections applied (especially time-of-day and location specifics)

**Phase 3 — Finalize** (`finalize-ingest` IPC in main.js):
- Copies originals to `01_Portfolio/{collection}/originals/`
- Creates 3-tier web images:
  - `*-full.jpg` — 2000px JPEG @ 85% (CoverFlow hero, standard displays)
  - `*-hd.webp` — 3500px WebP @ 85% (lightbox on 4K/Retina displays)
  - `*-thumb.jpg` — 400px JPEG @ 80% (grid thumbnails)
- Signs full-size with C2PA content credentials (provenance)
- Uploads originals to Cloudflare R2 cloud storage
- Writes per-portfolio `_photos.json` metadata file

**Deploy** (`deploy-website` IPC in main.js):
- Aggregates all `_photos.json` → `data/photos.json`
- Copies web images to `images/` directory
- Runs `sync_gallery_data.py` to update gallery.html
- Git commit + push → Cloudflare Pages auto-deploys

#### What Studio Generates vs What Agent Adds

| Field | Studio (during ingest) | Agent (vision analysis) |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Title | ✅ AI-generated, user-reviewed | suggested_title (alternative) |
| Description | ✅ AI-generated, user-reviewed | — |
| Location | ✅ AI + EXIF GPS | — |
| Tags | ✅ AI-generated, user-reviewed | ✅ Additional tags (OVERLAP) |
| Mood | — | ✅ Agent-only |
| Composition | — | ✅ Agent-only |
| Marketability score | — | ✅ Agent-only (1-10) |
| EXIF data | ✅ Extracted during ingest | Imported from 01_Portfolio |

**Key insight:** Agent's unique value-add is mood, composition analysis, and marketability scoring. Tags overlap with Studio's AI tags but may add different descriptors. Agent should NOT overwrite Studio's user-reviewed titles/descriptions.

#### Master Image Source of Truth

**`photography/` folder** in the repo root is the ONE source of truth for all published images:
- **744 images across 40 gallery folders** (as of Feb 2026)
- Each subfolder = one gallery (e.g., `photography/Iceland/`, `photography/Tanzania/`)
- New galleries added by creating new folders; folder structure may grow
- Images can only be **copied out**, never deleted (only Wolf deletes)
- From here, images flow to: R2 bucket, thumbnails, web-optimized copies, etc.

```
photography/{gallery}/*.jpg  →  Source of truth (raw published images)
```

#### Web Image Tiers (3-Tier Responsive)

As of Feb 2026, every published photo exists in three web-optimized sizes:

| Tier | File Pattern | Max Size | Format | Avg Size | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Thumbnail | `*-thumb.jpg` | 400px | JPEG 80% | ~16 KB | Gallery grid, CoverFlow sidebar |
| Full | `*-full.jpg` | 2000px | JPEG 85% | ~509 KB | CoverFlow hero, standard displays |
| HD | `*-hd.webp` | 3500px | WebP 85% | ~922 KB | Lightbox on 4K/Retina (DPR > 1) |

**How it works:**
- Gallery grid loads thumbnails (400px) — fast, minimal bandwidth
- CoverFlow hero loads full (2000px) — sharp enough at typical card size
- Lightbox loads full FIRST (instant display), then swaps to HD WebP on high-DPI displays
- The swap is seamless — user sees 2000px immediately, then gets 3500px upgrade
- On standard displays (DPR 1), HD WebP is never loaded — zero extra bandwidth

**Why 3500px, not 4000px?** On a 4K display at DPR 2, the lightbox maxes out at ~4260 device pixels. 3500px at WebP quality 85 provides visually sharp results with acceptable file sizes. The step from 2000px → 3500px eliminates the visible softness; going to 4000px adds ~40% more bytes for diminishing perceptual returns.

**Batch generation:** `python3 scripts/generate_hd_webp.py --all` regenerates from Photography/ originals.

#### Agent Photo Import Flow

Agent's `import_photos.py` currently imports from `01_Portfolio/*/originals/` — but the **canonical source** is `photography/`. The Agent should reference `photography/` for any image operations where originals are needed.

```
photography/{gallery}/*.jpg           →  Source of truth
01_Portfolio/{collection}/originals/  →  Studio-processed copies (may not match 1:1)
01_Portfolio/{collection}/_photos.json →  EXIF + Studio metadata
```

#### Anthropic API Key Strategy (Updated)

- **Real key location:** Root `.env` at `~/Documents/Archive-35.com/.env` (shared with Studio)
- **Agent .env:** Has placeholder `sk-ant-...` — NOT a real key
- **Fallback logic:** `_get_anthropic_client()` in api.py checks Agent .env first, then falls back to root .env
- **Models used:** Vision = `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, Content = `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
- **Rate limits:** 500 calls/day, $5.00/day budget (configurable in config.py)

### Agent API Key Strategy

- **Shared keys** (Anthropic, R2, Pictorem): Read from Studio .env via `getAgentConfig()` IPC
- **Agent-specific keys** (Late API, Telegram, Etsy, Shopify): Stored in Agent .env, managed via Agent Settings tab

### Vision Batch Operations

To run vision analysis on all unanalyzed photos:
```bash
cd "Archive 35 Agent"
nohup python3 scripts/run_vision_batch.py > vision_batch.log 2>&1 &
```
- Requires Agent API running on port 8035 (Studio must be open)
- Processes one photo at a time with 60s timeout
- Failed photos marked with `vision_mood='error'` to prevent infinite retries
- Progress: check `tail -f vision_batch.log` or query DB directly
- Images >4.5MB auto-resized via PIL before sending to Claude API

## 🛡️ Code Safety Protocol — MANDATORY Before Modifying Files

**This codebase has 3 interconnected systems (Studio, Agent, Mockup) with shared dependencies. A change in one file can break all three systems. Follow this protocol EVERY TIME.**

### Pre-Modification Checklist

Before editing ANY file in the Critical Files table above, or any file in `05_Studio/app/main.js`, `preload.js`, `App.js`, or `Sidebar.js`:

1. **Read `08_Docs/CONSTRAINTS.md`** — Check if the file has hard rules. If it does, follow them exactly. Only Wolf can grant exceptions.
2. **Read the file header** — Critical files have structured safety headers listing dependencies, side effects, and required reading.
3. **Read `08_Docs/LESSONS_LEARNED.md`** — Search for lessons related to the file or feature you're changing. Pay special attention to ROOT-CAUSE lessons (022, 023, 027, 029).
4. **Identify ALL consumers** — Before changing any data format, function signature, or file path, grep the entire project for references. Fix ALL consumers, not just the one you found.
5. **One change at a time** — Make one change → test → verify → then next. Never batch unrelated changes.

### The Three Safety Layers

| Layer | File | Purpose | Who can override? |
|-------|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Stop Sign** | `08_Docs/CONSTRAINTS.md` | Hard "NEVER" rules per critical file | Wolf only |
| **Speed Bump** | File headers in source code | Dependency hints + "read first" pointers | Wolf only |
| **Guardrails** | This CLAUDE.md section | Process checklist + zone rules | Wolf only |

### File Safety Header Format

Critical source files should have this header format:
```
// ⚠️ PROTECTED FILE — Risk: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM]
// Dependencies: [list files that read/write this file]
// Side effects: [what happens if this file changes]
// Read first: CONSTRAINTS.md, LESSONS_LEARNED.md #NNN
// Consumers: [which systems use this file: Studio/Agent/Mockup/Website]
```

### Generated vs Source Files — Know the Difference

| Generated (DON'T hand-edit) | Source (edit these instead) |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `data/photos.json` | `01_Portfolio/*/_photos.json` |
| `gallery.html` inline `const G=[...]` | `data/photos.json` (via sync_gallery_data.py) |
| `_site/` output | Source HTML/JS/CSS files |

### Three-System Impact Check

Before modifying shared files, verify impact on all three systems:

| System | How to test | What to check |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| **Studio** | Open Electron app | All 12 tabs load, deploy pipeline runs |
| **Agent** | Start Agent from Studio | All 7 tabs load, Dashboard shows ONLINE |
| **Mockup** | Start Mockup from Studio | All 4 tabs load, preview generates |

## 🔧 Chrome Extension Development — MANDATORY Protocol

**This section applies to ALL files in `07_Extensions/`.** Read LESSONS_LEARNED.md #041 and #042 before starting.

### The #1 Rule: OBSERVE Before You Code

**NEVER write a fix based on reasoning alone.** You have Chrome browser access — use it EVERY TIME:

1. **Before writing any fix:** Open the target page in Chrome, take a screenshot, run JS in the console to verify your assumptions
2. **After every push:** Tell Wolf to `git pull` + reload extension in `chrome://extensions` — extension code on disk ≠ code loaded in Chrome
3. **When Wolf says "not working":** Check the browser FIRST. Don't theorize — observe
4. **When 2+ fixes fail:** STOP. Read LESSONS_LEARNED.md #023 and #041. The problem is your debugging approach, not the code

### MV3 Extension Architecture Rules

- **Service workers die after ~30s** of only setTimeout activity → Use keepalive port (`chrome.runtime.connect`)
- **Popups auto-close** when Chrome navigates any tab → Use tab promotion for long operations
- **Content scripts auto-inject** on matching URLs, including hidden/scrape tabs → Track temporary tab IDs in a Set and exclude from state management
- **`chrome.tabs.create()` triggers content script injection** → Any scrape tab will send `pageStatus` and clobber your tracked tab ID unless you exclude it

### CaFE Uploader Specific

| File | Purpose | Key gotcha |
|------|---------|------------|
| background.js | Upload orchestrator, portfolio scraping | `scrapeTabIds` Set prevents hidden tabs from overwriting `cafeTabId` |
| popup.js | UI, folder scanning, portfolio sync | Opens as full tab (not popup) to survive navigations |
| content.js | Ping, scrapePortfolio, pageStatus | Auto-injects on ALL callforentry.org pages including scrape tabs |
| manifest.json | MV3, host_permissions for CaFE | `content_scripts` matches `artist.callforentry.org/*` |

### CaFE Portfolio Scraping — How Dedup Works

1. `getPortfolioTitles()` creates a **hidden background tab** to `portfolio.php` (active:false)
2. Waits for page load + 3s for client-side JS rendering (CaFE uses `{{details.title}}` templates)
3. Scrapes `<figcaption>` text from rendered DOM via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`
4. Compares scraped titles against `submission.json` titles (case-insensitive trim)
5. **Does NOT need a pre-existing CaFE tab** — creates its own

**Known failure modes:**
- `fetch()` of CaFE pages returns unrendered `{{templates}}` — must use hidden tab approach
- Scrape tab's content script sends `pageStatus` → must be excluded via `scrapeTabIds`
- If portfolio has 0 figcaptions, fallback selectors try `img[alt]` and `[data-title]`

### Extension Testing Checklist

Before telling Wolf a fix is ready:
- [ ] `git pull` + reload extension in `chrome://extensions`
- [ ] Open the extension (click icon) → verify it opens as a tab
- [ ] Select the CaFE Ready folder
- [ ] Verify stats show correct existing/new counts
- [ ] Verify only NEW images appear in upload queue
- [ ] Start upload → verify first image completes
- [ ] Check service worker console (chrome://extensions → Inspect views) for errors
