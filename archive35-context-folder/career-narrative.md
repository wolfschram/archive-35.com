## The 30-Second Story

"I've spent 25 years building leadership capabilities — from hands-on broadcast engineering in Germany, to designing touring systems for U2 and the Rolling Stones, to leading 250 engineers globally. But my product isn't technical expertise. It's **leadership for leaders** — creating ownership cultures where complex minds thrive. I've learned that the most sophisticated technical challenges are really people challenges, and my greatest impact comes from empowering engineering leaders to own their domains completely."

## Career Arc (Problem→Product→Result Format)

### Chapter 1: Germany (1998-2004)
**Problem:** Needed to learn the craft from the ground up
**Product:** Deep technical foundation in broadcast engineering
**Result:** Built credibility and expertise that would later inform leadership decisions

### Chapter 2: UK Music Industry - PRG (2004-2014)
**Problem:** World's biggest touring acts needed reliable, innovative production systems
**Product:** Led engineering for U2, Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Queen, Beyoncé, Metallica
**Result:** Learned to lead under pressure, build trust with demanding stakeholders, deliver when failure isn't an option

**Key Insight:** "These artists trusted us with their legacy. That taught me the weight of accountability and the power of empowerment — I couldn't micromanage every system, I had to build teams that owned their domains."

### Chapter 3: US Leadership (2014-2026)
**Problem:** Enterprise AV/broadcast integration needed transformation from project delivery to engineering excellence
**Product:** Built global engineering organizations, developed leaders, created accountability frameworks
**Result:** 
- Led 250+ engineers across North America, Europe, Asia
- Pioneered SMPTE 2110 IP systems adoption
- Built unified structures through post-merger integration
- Created leadership development pipelines

## Leadership Stories (Use for Behavioral Questions)

### Story: "The Ownership Culture"
**Situation:** Post-merger, had teams from different companies with conflicting cultures and unclear accountabilities
**Task:** Unify 250 engineers under one leadership philosophy
**Action:** 
- Introduced "6-point accountability clarity" framework
- Trained leaders to lead with questions, not directives
- Created "Ship, Shipmate, Self" priority structure
- Gave regional leads full ownership of their domains
**Result:** Teams that self-organize, escalate appropriately, and deliver without constant oversight

### Story: "Developing the Developer"
**Situation:** Had a promising engineer struggling to make the leap to leadership
**Task:** Help them grow without pushing them into a mold
**Action:**
- Met weekly for coaching, not status updates
- Asked questions instead of giving answers
- Let them fail safely, then reflected together
- Celebrated when they developed their own leadership style
**Result:** They're now leading their own team and developing others the same way

### Story: "The Complex Mind"
**Situation:** Brilliant engineer causing friction, being labeled "difficult"
**Task:** Unlock their potential instead of managing them out
**Action:**
- Recognized the behavior came from not feeling heard
- Created space for their ideas to be genuinely considered
- Gave them ownership of a challenging problem
- Protected them from organizational politics
**Result:** Became one of the highest performers, now mentors others

## Differentiators

**What makes Wolf different from other VP Engineering candidates:**

1. **Technical credibility + people focus** — Can go deep on SMPTE 2110, but leads with people development
2. **International perspective** — Germany → UK → US, three cultural contexts
3. **High-stakes experience** — Live broadcast, touring production where failure is visible to millions
4. **Transformation track record** — Post-merger integration, building from scratch
5. **Servant leadership in practice** — Not just philosophy, documented frameworks and results

## Questions Wolf Should Ask Interviewers

**About Culture:**
- "How do engineering leaders here develop their people?"
- "When someone fails, what happens?"
- "Tell me about a time the org prioritized people development over short-term delivery"

**About the Role:**
- "What does success look like in 6 months? 18 months?"
- "What's the biggest people challenge in engineering right now?"
- "How much autonomy do engineering leaders have?"

**About Leadership:**
- "How does the executive team resolve disagreement?"
- "What's an unpopular decision you made and how did you bring the org along?"
- "Who was the last engineering leader you developed, and where are they now?"

## Red Flags Wolf Should Watch For

❌ "We need someone to hold engineers accountable" (control culture)
❌ "We move fast and break things" (no room for thoughtful leadership)
❌ Heavy emphasis on technical skills over leadership capabilities
❌ No clear answer to "how do you develop leaders?"
❌ Executive team that can't articulate engineering's strategic role

## Salary/Comp Framework

Wolf's target range (LA market, VP Engineering):
- Base: $275K-$350K
- Bonus: 20-30%
- Equity: Meaningful package for growth-stage, negotiable for enterprise

**Negotiation stance:** "Compensation should reflect the value I bring. I'm more interested in finding the right culture fit, but I expect to be compensated competitively for a VP Engineering role in this market."
