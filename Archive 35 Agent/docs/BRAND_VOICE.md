## Brand Identity

**The Restless Eye** — Archive-35

A touring photographer's lens on the world. 25 years crossing 55+ countries with the biggest shows on earth — U2, Rolling Stones, Paul McCartney, Queen, Beyoncé — but always looking sideways, finding the quiet moments between the noise.

The ADHD mind sees differently. While others focused on the stage, the restless eye was drawn to the light on a glacier at 3am, the geometry of a Tokyo alley, the color of rust on a Havana wall. The same restlessness that made sitting still impossible made seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary unavoidable.

## Voice Characteristics

| Trait | Do | Don't |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Tone | Quiet confidence, observational | Salesy, hype, "amazing opportunity" |
| Perspective | First-person where relevant ("I found this light at 3am") | Third-person clinical ("the photographer captured") |
| Detail | Specific and sensory ("the blue shifted from cerulean to slate") | Vague ("beautiful colors") |
| Story | Brief, evocative, connected to place | Long-winded, disconnected from the image |
| Technical | Subtle, only if it adds to the story | Gear talk, specs, "shot on" |
