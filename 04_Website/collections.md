## Iceland Moody
**Status:** Active
**Image count:** TBD

The Westfjords in weather. Fog rolling through valleys. Light that changes every thirty seconds. Iceland doesn't perform—it simply exists, and you catch what you can.

## Mountain Light
**Status:** Active
**Image count:** TBD

Dawn in high places. The moment before the sun clears the ridge. That brief window when everything glows.

---

## Urban Asia
**Status:** Active
**Image count:** TBD

Neon and rain. Tokyo's quiet corners. The contrast between density and solitude in cities of millions.

---

## American West
**Status:** Active
**Image count:** TBD

Empty roads. Desert light. The scale of the landscape against the smallness of everything else.

---

## Grand Teton
**Status:** Upcoming (trip planned)
