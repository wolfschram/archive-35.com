        <h2>1. Custom/Made-to-Order Products</h2>
        <p>All prints sold through Archive-35 are custom, made-to-order products. Each print is produced specifically for you after your order is placed. Production begins immediately upon payment confirmation.</p>
        <p>Due to the custom nature of these products, the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations right to cancellation does not apply.</p>

        <h2>2. Art Is Subjective — All Sales Final</h2>
        <p><strong>All sales are final. No returns or refunds.</strong></p>
        <p>Photography is a form of fine art. By its nature, the appreciation of art is subjective — what resonates deeply with one person may not appeal to another. By completing your purchase, you acknowledge and accept that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Aesthetic preference is not grounds for a return.</strong> Dissatisfaction based on personal taste, style, mood, or subjective visual preference does not qualify for a refund or exchange.</li>
          <li>Color variations between your screen and the physical print are normal and expected (see Section 4 below)</li>
          <li>Print dimensions are clearly displayed before purchase — size dissatisfaction is not grounds for a return</li>
          <li>Incorrect product or size selection by the customer is not grounds for a return</li>
          <li>Change of mind or buyer's remorse after receiving the print is not grounds for a return</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We encourage you to carefully review all product details, dimensions, and material descriptions before placing your order. If you have any questions about a specific photograph or print option, please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> before purchasing.</p>

        <h2>3. Damaged or Defective Prints — The Only Exception</h2>
        <p>If your print arrives damaged during shipping or has a manufacturing defect, we will work with our print fulfillment partner to replace it at no charge. To qualify for a replacement:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notify us within <strong>30 days</strong> of delivery via our <a href="contact.html">contact form</a></li>
          <li>Provide clear photographs of the damage or defect AND the original packaging</li>
          <li>Do not discard the packaging until the claim is fully resolved</li>
          <li>Damage must be shipping-related or a manufacturing defect — not handling damage after delivery</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our prints are produced by <strong>Pictorem</strong>, a professional fine art print fulfillment provider. Pictorem guarantees their print quality and will replace any print with a verified manufacturing defect. We reserve the right to deny claims that do not meet these requirements or where evidence of the defect is insufficient.</p>

        <h2>4. Color & Display Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Images displayed on this website are for reference only. Actual print colors may vary from what you see on your screen due to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor calibration and color profile differences</li>
          <li>Ambient lighting conditions when viewing your screen</li>
          <li>Display technology variations (LCD, OLED, etc.)</li>
          <li>Print substrate characteristics (canvas texture, metal sheen, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use professional color management in our printing process, but slight variations are normal and expected. Color variation is not grounds for a refund.</p>

        <h2>5. Production & Delivery Times</h2>
        <p>All prints are handcrafted by our professional print partner. Typical production times:</p>
        <ul>

        <h2>7. Payment & Security</h2>

        <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Archive-35's maximum liability for any claim related to your purchase shall not exceed the purchase price you paid for the specific item in question.</p>
        <p>We are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lost profits or revenue</li>

          <li>Any damages arising from circumstances beyond our reasonable control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>If you have a concern about your order, please contact us first through our contact form. We will make reasonable efforts to resolve any issues. Any disputes that cannot be resolved informally shall be subject to the laws of the State of Texas, United States.</p>

        <h2>10. Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Sale at any time. Changes will be effective immediately upon posting to this page. Your continued use of our website and services after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.</p>

        <h2>11. Print Fulfillment</h2>
        <p>All prints are produced and shipped by <strong>Pictorem</strong> (www.pictorem.com), a professional fine art print fulfillment service based in North America. Archive-35 is not directly responsible for printing or shipping, but we work closely with Pictorem to ensure quality standards are met. Any quality issues will be handled through our replacement process described in Section 3.</p>

        <h2>12. Agreement</h2>
