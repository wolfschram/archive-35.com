# Archive 35 — Task Queue

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20

## ⏰ Calendar Reminders
- [ ] **2026-08-20** — Cancel Etsy Plus subscription ($10/mo). Signed up 2026-02-20 for 6-month $29 credit + 15 listings/mo + $5 ads/mo. Re-evaluate ROI before canceling.

## 🔴 Priority (Immediate)
- [ ] Etsy shop setup — finish onboarding, configure shop settings, shipping profiles, API access
- [ ] Verify mobile layout on actual iPhone — gallery nav overlap, homepage text overlap
- [ ] Licensing page layout — Wolf wants bigger/wider grid like About page
- [ ] Apply for additional image licenses (Wolf mentioned pending applications)

## 🟡 In Progress / Needs Verification
- [ ] Mobile gallery: nav pushed down to 12-14vh, swipe sensitivity reduced — needs real device test
- [ ] Mobile homepage: "archive covering archive 35" overlap — needs real device test

## 🟢 Backlog
- [ ] Pictorem API automated order submission
- [ ] WELCOME10 promo code in Stripe
- [ ] Stripe webhooks for order fulfillment
- [ ] Google Drive backup integration in Studio app
- [ ] SocialMedia.js page (currently placeholder)
