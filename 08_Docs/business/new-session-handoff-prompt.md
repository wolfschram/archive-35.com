## Context: Archive-35.com — Fine Art Photography Business

I'm Wolf Schram, VP of Engineering (25+ years broadcast/AV/enterprise tech), starting Archive-35.com as a fine art photography e-commerce business. I have ADHD/dyslexia — keep things scannable with bullet points and clear hierarchy. Default to .docx for documents. I'm bilingual German/English but prefer English responses.

### What's Already Built (Sessions 1-5):
- **Website**: archive-35.com on Cloudflare Pages (3 collections: Grand Teton 48 photos, Africa 44, New Zealand 16)
- **Studio App**: Electron/React desktop app for photo management, ingest, deployment
- **E-commerce**: Stripe checkout → Pictorem print fulfillment (canvas, metal, acrylic, paper, wood)
- **AI Commerce**: MCP server (cloud), OpenAI Agentic Commerce Protocol, product feed
- **Content Protection**: C2PA credentials on all 108 images, legal pages, robots.txt
- **SEO**: Schema.org JSON-LD, sitemap, Open Graph tags
- **Photo Quality MCP Server**: Local FastMCP server with 4 analysis tools (sharpness, noise, dynamic range, print readiness)
- **Repo**: github.com/wolfschram/archive-35.com — all code committed and pushed

### Business Documents Already Created (in 08_Docs/business/):
- `archive35-edd-execution-guide.docx` — Step-by-step EDD unemployment filing guide
- `archive35-addendum-tax-selfemployment.docx` — Tax obligations for self-employment
- `archive35-tax-tracker.xlsx` — 4-tab Excel (Sales Log, Expenses, Quarterly Summary, EDD Reporting)

### Google Workspace Status:
- Account: wolf@archive-35.com (Google Workspace Business Plus, 5 TB storage, 3.01 TB used)
- schramfamily.com is still the primary domain (can't be changed — was purchased during signup)
- archive-35.com is secondary domain but is what I actually use for everything
- Switched Google Drive from Mirror to Stream mode (cloud-only, saving ~3 TB local disk)
- wolfbroadcast@gmail.com is my separate personal Gmail (15 GB free tier)

### TASKS I NEED HELP WITH:

**1. EDD / Unemployment Filing (URGENT)**
- I need to file my EDD unemployment claim (recently separated from employer)
- The execution guide is already written — I need help actually walking through the process
- CA EDD website: edd.ca.gov
- Need to understand how self-employment income from Archive-35 affects my claim

**2. Business Entity Setup**
- Apply for EIN (Employer Identification Number) from IRS — needed for business bank account and taxes
- File DBA ("Doing Business As") for Archive-35 in California
- Apply for CA Seller's Permit (required for collecting sales tax on prints)
- Apply for Home Occupation Permit (if required by my city)

**3. Business Banking**
- Open a dedicated business bank account (separate from personal)
- Need EIN first
- Connect to Stripe for payouts

**4. Tax Setup for 2026**
- Quarterly estimated tax payments (federal + CA) — as self-employed
- Schedule SE (self-employment tax) planning
- Sales tax collection and remittance setup for CA
- Track expenses for Schedule C deductions
- The tax tracker spreadsheet is already built — need to start using it

**5. Stripe Activation**
- Complete Stripe account activation (currently in test mode for some features)
- Ensure webhooks, fulfillment flow, and payout settings are production-ready

Please start by helping me prioritize these tasks in order of urgency/dependency (some depend on others — e.g., can't open bank account without EIN). Then let's tackle them one by one.
